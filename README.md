Material of video PE-72 entitled: Improved Dynamic Model of Voltage-Mode-Controlled DC-DC Converters including Sampling Effect

Available at: https://youtu.be/8rZ7JZ9TZJU

This video explains how to analyze the dynamic behavior of a voltage-mode-controlled DC-DC converter including sampling effect. The modulator sampling effect produces a phase lag that adds to the phase of the converter. This can make the converter unstable in closed loop if the loop-gain bandwidth is too close to half of the switching frequency. The model is verified by Qspice simulation.
